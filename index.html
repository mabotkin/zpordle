		<h2>Rules</h2>
		<p>
			Each day, a random integer will be picked between 0 and 1000.  You will then have 10 guesses to guess the number.  Each guess will be associated with a prime number, given in increasing order.  For a guess associated with prime p, the game will tell you the p-adic distance between your guess and the target number.  Good luck!
		</p>
		<h3>p-adic Distance</h3>
		<p>
			For a fixed prime p, define the p-adic norm of an integer x as p^-k, where x = np^k, with n not divisible by p.  For example, for p = 3, the p-adic norm of 6 is 1/3, the p-adic norm of 9 is 1/9, and the p-adic norm of 11 is 1.  The p-adic distance between two integers is the p-adic norm of the difference.
